# Hi, I'm Lianrui Geng (Bruce) 👋

Currently, I'm an enthusiastic Computer Science undergraduate at the **University of Utah**, complemented by a minor in Mathematics. I'm set to graduate in **December 2024** and am keen to explore the vibrant intersection of technology, creativity, and academia.

## 🎓 Academic Journey

My academic path reflects a strong dedication to both **computer science and mathematics**, backed by a GPA of **3.53/4**. For me, success isn't just about grades—it's about curiosity, exploration, and the passion put into learning. This approach drives me to seek practical, hands-on experiences.

### 👨‍🏫 Teaching and Learning

I also value the role of teaching. As an **assistant instructor** with the educational organization **Qizhi**, I helped high school students grasp mathematics and physics. This role has been instrumental in honing my communication and teaching skills, letting me share my enthusiasm for these subjects effectively.

## 💻 Coding, Collaboration, and Creativity

I thrive in collaborative environments and enjoy solving complex problems alongside my peers. Coding isn't just an academic exercise—it's a creative outlet. Below are some of the projects that showcase my work:

- **Educational App**  
  Developed a collaborative **university project** using **C++ and Qt**. The application introduces users to **linear regression in Machine Learning** with simple visualizations, providing an educational tool for beginners.

- **Gaming Projects**  
  Created engaging games in **C#**, including a version of the classic **Snake Game** and a multiplayer version of **Agar.io** with **client-server architecture**. These projects combined creativity with technical skills to deliver an entertaining experience.

- **Computer Graphics Explorations**  
  Recently, I've explored **computer graphics** through projects focused on **ray tracing, rasterization, and simulations**. These were built using **JavaScript and WebGL shader technology**, showcasing my adaptability and rapid learning of new technologies.

Feel free to explore more of my work on [**GitHub**](https://github.com/LianruiBruce?tab=repositories).

## 🌱 A Kind and Friendly Explorer

At heart, I am a **kind and friendly** person, ready to dive into new challenges and learn rapidly. Be it tackling a complex coding problem or unraveling a novel mathematical concept, I embrace each challenge with an open mind and a spirit of collaboration.

## 🚀 Looking Ahead

With my graduation approaching, I am eager to embark on new journeys—whether that's through an **industry role** that will push my skills further or a **graduate project** that allows me to explore my areas of interest in depth. This website is a window into my professional and academic endeavors, showcasing my projects, skills, and aspirations.

## 🤝 Let's Connect!

If you'd like to learn more about my work, discuss potential collaborations, or consider me for opportunities that align with my skills and passions, please **reach out**. I'm always excited about the opportunities that lie ahead and look forward to connecting with others who share my enthusiasm for technology and exploration.


<!-- **Markdown generator**

I have also created [a set of Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/markdown_generator
) that converts a CSV containing structured data about talks or presentations into individual markdown files that will be properly formatted for the academicpages template. The sample CSVs in that directory are the ones I used to create my own personal website at stuartgeiger.com. My usual workflow is that I keep a spreadsheet of my publications and talks, then run the code in these notebooks to generate the markdown files, then commit and push them to the GitHub repository.

How to edit your site's GitHub repository
------
Many people use a git client to create files on their local computer and then push them to GitHub's servers. If you are not familiar with git, you can directly edit these configuration and markdown files directly in the github.com interface. Navigate to a file (like [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_talks/2012-03-01-talk-1.md) and click the pencil icon in the top right of the content preview (to the right of the "Raw | Blame | History" buttons). You can delete a file by clicking the trashcan icon to the right of the pencil icon. You can also create new files or upload files by navigating to a directory and clicking the "Create new file" or "Upload files" buttons.
