I'm Lianrui Geng, but you can call me Bruce. Currently, I'm on an exciting journey as a Computer Science undergraduate at the University of Utah, coupled with a minor in Mathematics. With my anticipated graduation in December 2024, I am eagerly exploring the vibrant intersection of technology and academia.

My Academic and Teaching Journey
======
My academic path is marked by a strong dedication to both computer science and mathematics, reflected in my current GPA of 3.64/4. However, I believe in measuring success not just by grades, but by the depth of one's curiosity and the effort invested in pursuing passions. This philosophy has led me to value hands-on experiences and practical learning.

In the realm of education, I have had the privilege of serving as an assistant instructor with the educational organization "Qizhi," where I nurtured high school students' understanding of mathematics and physics. This experience honed my skills in communication and teaching, allowing me to share my passion for these subjects effectively.

Coding, Collaboration, and Creativity
======
I thrive in collaborative environments, working alongside peers to address complex problems. My interest in coding is not just academic; it's a canvas for my creativity. Some of my notable projects include:
  * Educational App:
    A collaborative university project where we developed an application using C++ and Qt. This app introduces users to linear regression in Machine Learning through basic visualizations.
  * Gaming Projects：
    I've channeled my coding skills into creating engaging games. Using C#, I developed versions of the popular Snake Game and Agar.io, incorporating client-server architecture for multiplayer experiences.
  * Computer Graphics Explorations：
    Recently, I've delved into computer graphics, creating projects centered on ray tracing, rasterization, and simulations. These were crafted using JavaScript and WebGL's shader technology, demonstrating my ability to learn and apply new skills rapidly.

A Kind and Friendly Explorer
------
At heart, I am a kind, friendly individual who's always ready to dive into new experiences and learn rapidly. Whether it's a complex coding challenge or an unexplored mathematical concept, I approach each with an open mind and a collaborative spirit. 

Looking Ahead
------
As I approach the culmination of my undergraduate studies, I am keen to extend my journey either through employment that challenges and grows my skill set or through a graduate project that allows me to delve deeper into my areas of interest. This website serves as a portal into my professional and academic life, showcasing my projects, skills, and aspirations.

Let's Connect
------
If you're interested in learning more about my work, discussing potential collaborations, or considering me for opportunities that align with my skills and passions, please feel free to reach out. I am excited about the prospects that lie ahead and look forward to connecting with like-minded individuals and organizations.

<!-- **Markdown generator**

I have also created [a set of Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/markdown_generator
) that converts a CSV containing structured data about talks or presentations into individual markdown files that will be properly formatted for the academicpages template. The sample CSVs in that directory are the ones I used to create my own personal website at stuartgeiger.com. My usual workflow is that I keep a spreadsheet of my publications and talks, then run the code in these notebooks to generate the markdown files, then commit and push them to the GitHub repository.

How to edit your site's GitHub repository
------
Many people use a git client to create files on their local computer and then push them to GitHub's servers. If you are not familiar with git, you can directly edit these configuration and markdown files directly in the github.com interface. Navigate to a file (like [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_talks/2012-03-01-talk-1.md) and click the pencil icon in the top right of the content preview (to the right of the "Raw | Blame | History" buttons). You can delete a file by clicking the trashcan icon to the right of the pencil icon. You can also create new files or upload files by navigating to a directory and clicking the "Create new file" or "Upload files" buttons.
